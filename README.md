# MyApplicationDemo

## Description
This is a demo desktop app that demonstrates the use of the DesktopBusinessAppSharpBuilder Framework.

The SQLite database has a table named User which is empty.

If the user table is empty, the System assumes that the software is running for the first time on the local machine.
A dialog will prompt the user to register themselves. Here, the user can provide a username and password.

Upon registration, the user will be asked to login with their new credentials.

Delete the user from the database to repeat the process.
